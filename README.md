##  WxCollection

This is an iOS side project to support the weather alert app. It is being used to develop the user interface (UI) for weather icons and data layout. 

### Project Details

Three UICollectionViews are used in the UI. At the top of the display is a horizontal list of placeholder weather alert icons. If the 7 day forecast has weather alert data, a corresponding weather alert icon will be added to this horizontal scrollable list. 

In the middle of the UI display is the primary weather display screen for the weather alert app. It shows placeholder information for the 7 day weather forecast including a placeholder weather alert image.

The bottom most view shows a horizontal list of cities that the user has chosen to have the weather displayed. City name is abbreviated with the first three letters of the city name in upper case letters.
